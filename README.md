Shoutout to [perikiyoxd](https://github.com/perikiyoxd), they helped me figure out a much better approach by utilizing `_Process(double delta)` for accumulating resources per their respective rates. If it wasn't for them I would still be using Godot timers going down a very different unneedingly complex path.

Thank you to [SadColourfulHues](https://github.com/SadColourfulHues) for really cleaning up the tech page and adding several more features to it. I have learned a lot from them of when to use `Span<T>`, `Godot.Resource` and `static`. They have been a really big help, you should go check them out.
